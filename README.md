## Comparing beef prices for carcasses in Ireland and France
### A data science approach to investigation into the price of beef carcasses in Ireland and France using data from [ireland_france_2_years_beef](https://agridata.ec.europa.eu/extensions/DashboardBeef/BeefPricesExt.html#) and [barley_prices](https://agridata.ec.europa.eu/extensions/DashboardCereals/ExtCerealsPrice.html#)
#### Accurate prediction of cattle prices can significantly impact the profitability of farmers and the cost of meat for consumers. In this project, we develop machine learning models to predict the price of cattle carcasses in Ireland and France. We gather and analyse data on various factors that may influence cattle prices, such as year, week, feed price, and cattle category, and use multiple machine learning models to identify the most effective model for predicting cattle prices. Our study incorporates sentiment analysis of grain prices to provide a comprehensive understanding of market conditions that impact cattle prices. The results of this project provide valuable insights and tools for farmers to optimize their operations and maximize profits.
